At Start Academia, we design **zero-to-one career programs** for people who want to take a real first step into Mexico’s digital job market and the global remote economy.

To keep growing in a structured way, our programs are organized into **three families**.  

<br>

## 1. Tech & Product Careers

The Tech & Product family focuses on training the next generation of engineers and builders, empowered through the use of AI tools.

### Manual Tester for Web & Mobile Apps

**Pathway:** Software Quality & Testing  
**Target role:** Junior QA Manual Tester / QA Analyst (Manual)  
**Ideal for:** People who enjoy logic, order, and details, even if they have never worked in IT.

This program takes you from a **curious user** to a **junior tester** who can participate in real software projects. You learn the role of QA in the software lifecycle, how to turn requirements into clear test cases, and how to test web and mobile apps in a systematic way. You also practice reporting defects with professional language, screenshots, and short recordings, and you learn to use AI as support for test ideas, bug descriptions, and short status updates for your team.

**Structure & time commitment**

- **Duration:** 12 weeks  
- **Weekly load:** ~4 hours (live or recorded sessions + guided practice)  
- **Format:** Practice-first, with clear monthly milestones.

<br>


**What you leave with**

- A **junior QA portfolio** with test case suites, bug reports, and at least one small test plan.
- Demonstrated experience testing web and mobile features using simple industry workflows (issue trackers, boards, or spreadsheets).
- Readiness to apply for **Junior QA Manual Tester / QA Analyst** roles in Mexican and remote markets.

Future additions in this family:
New Tech & Product programs (for example automation testing or junior data roles) will follow the same structure and will be added under this section.

## 2. Operations & Service Careers

### Bilingual Virtual Assistant & Operations Assistant

**Pathway:** Business Operations & Remote Support  
**Target role:** Bilingual Virtual Assistant / Operations Assistant (Remote)  
**Ideal for:** Organized, responsible people who like helping others stay on top of their work.

This program prepares you for **remote operations roles** where reliability, clarity, and communication matter more than job titles. You learn to manage email and calendars for a simulated executive, create simple and clear process documentation (SOPs), and use tools such as Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Notion, Trello or ClickUp. You also learn to keep small projects moving with basic dashboards and task boards, and to use AI to draft emails, turn raw notes into summaries or SOPs, and clean simple spreadsheets.

**Structure & time commitment**

- **Duration:** 12 weeks  
- **Weekly load:** ~4 hours  
- **Format:** Client simulations, small weekly challenges, and guided reflections.

<br>

**What you leave with**

- A **remote-ready portfolio** that shows you can keep someone organized, communicate professionally, and use AI to work faster without losing quality.
- Greater readiness to apply for **VA and Operations Assistant** roles with founders, agencies, and small businesses.

## 3. Content, Community & Trust Careers

### User Operations Associate

**Pathway:** Trust & Safety, Community Health & Online Platforms  
**Target role:** Content Moderator / Trust & Safety Associate / User Operations Agent  
**Ideal for:** People with strong reading comprehension (Spanish + basic/intermediate English) who are comfortable working with rules, criteria, and sometimes emotionally demanding material.

This program introduces you to the world of **online safety and content moderation**, where clear judgment and emotional care are essential. You learn the basics of Trust & Safety, how content policies work, and how to turn them into simple decision rules. You practice reviewing text-based content, deciding whether to allow, remove, or escalate, and logging your decisions in a structured way. You also learn to write neutral, policy-based rationales and user notifications, and to use AI to summarize long posts, generate clarifying questions, and polish communication.

We place special emphasis on **emotional hygiene and self-care**, as this type of work can be intense.

**Structure & time commitment**

- **Duration:** 12 weeks  
- **Weekly load:** ~4 hours  
- **Format:** Synthetic moderation queues, case discussions, and reflective exercises.
